### About Me

I’m a **data-driven problem solver** who enjoys turning messy data into **reliable pipelines, meaningful analysis, and practical machine learning solutions**.

My work sits at the intersection of **data engineering, analytics, and applied AI**. I like building systems that are:
- Scalable and reproducible  
- Easy to reason about  
- Focused on real-world decision-making  

I care about **strong fundamentals**, clean implementation, and understanding *why* a model or pipeline behaves the way it does.

---

### What I Work With

I build **end-to-end data workflows** — from ingestion and transformation to analysis, modeling, and insight delivery.

**Data Engineering**
- Python-based ETL pipelines and data transformations  
- Batch and API-driven data ingestion  
- Data validation, testing, and automation  
- Relational and NoSQL data stores  
- Cloud-native data workflows  

**Analytics & Visualization**
- Exploratory data analysis and feature understanding  
- KPI tracking and analytical dashboards  
- Python-driven visual analysis  
- Translating raw data into clear, actionable insights  

**Machine Learning & AI**
- Supervised and unsupervised learning fundamentals  
- Regularization, model selection, and evaluation  
- Feature engineering and performance tuning  
- Applied NLP and LLM-based pipelines  
- Prompt design and responsible AI practices  

**Platforms & Tools**
- Python, SQL, PySpark  
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- Power BI, Streamlit, Tableau  
- AWS and Azure data services  
- Git and reproducible workflows

### What You’ll Find Here

On this profile, you’ll find projects that focus on:
- Data cleaning, validation, and pipeline design  
- Exploratory analysis and visualization  
- Machine learning fundamentals and experiments  
- Applied AI and NLP workflows  
- Clear documentation and reproducible results  

Each repository is designed to be **readable, structured, and easy to follow**.

---

### Demos & Walkthroughs

For selected projects, I include:
- Short walkthrough videos explaining the problem and approach  
- Notebook-based experiments with clear outputs  
- End-to-end demos covering data ingestion → processing → results  

Demo links (including YouTube walkthroughs) are added directly inside project repositories and pinned projects.
